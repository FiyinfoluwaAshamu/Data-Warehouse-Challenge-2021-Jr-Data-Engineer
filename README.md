# Data-Warehouse-Challenge-2021-Jr-Data-Engineer

# Project Overview

The objective of this project was to extract data from two endpoints. The datasets were then transformed into three tables (Users, subscription, and messages) to produce metrics based on these columns ( date, age, city, country, email domain, gender, smoking condition, income, subscriptions and messages) for analyticsThen python was used to load the datasets into the database.

## Data Modelling
Using the  datasets, I created db schema optimized for queries for analysis, which includes the tables mentioned above.
